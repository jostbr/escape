# Escape
Based on the classic, "Zork", this is a simple text-based adventure game where a teleportation experiment goes horribly wrong and places you on an unknown alien planet. You must explore your new sorroundings and figure out a way to escape the planet and get back home to earth.

### DISLAIMER: This was one of mye first ever code projects so it's rather unstructured and full of badly written and hard-to-extend spaghetti code. :P
